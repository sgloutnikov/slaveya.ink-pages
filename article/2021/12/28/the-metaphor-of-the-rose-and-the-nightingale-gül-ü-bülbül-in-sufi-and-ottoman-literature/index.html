<p>The words “rose” and “nightingale”, widely used in oral and written Persian-Arabic literature since the early ages, began to be used also by Seljuk/Turkish authors at the end of the eleventh century and the beginning of the twelfth century, the early period of written Turkish literature. These metaphors were used by Sufi poets to describe religious mysticism, and authors outside of Sufi understanding used them to visualize the realities of social life and romance.</p>
<p>The word “bülbül” (‘nightingale’ in Turkish), originally from Persian, later entered Arabic and Turkish as well. The nightingale had an important place in Eastern literature. It sings more vividly in the days when roses bloom and it is accepted that there is an imaginary love relationship between it and the rose (the nightingale is the image of the passionate lover, and the rose is the beloved one). The relationship between them was accepted as figurative love, and because it was ignited with the strong love for the rose, the nightingale was given the adjectives ” şeydâ” (crazy) and “zâr” (crying and groaning). The biggest obstacle preventing the nightingale from approaching the rose is the rose’s thorns. Poets have seen this impossible love as an inexhaustible source for their poems. These symbols are frequently encountered in the divans of Iranian, Ottoman, and Albanian Bektashi poets. Although the classical divan poets talk about the nightingale according to certain rules, the folklore poets express it with a freer imagination and many times more vividly. If a poet of Divan literature who wrote religious (mystical) poetry, used the word “nightingale” in his poetry, it would mean a person who is burning with love for God and trying his best to reach it, while “rose” meant God, the absolute creator, and the mystic inspiration. For poets outside of religious life, the word “nightingale” was used to describe a lover who fell in love and was ready to give their best to be with their beloved one – “the Rose”. According to Sufi poets, the rose reflects another aspect of God, who is the absolute creator in every state. In Sufism, the rosebud is the image of the inaccessibility of the sacred being (God) and for by poets other than the understanding of mysticism– the rosebud is the freshness of a lover’s youth, beautiful enough to die for.</p>
<p>The nightingale has a huge role in Turkish proverbs and idioms and many songs in Turkish folklore literature were inspired by it. The nightingale is seen as the epitome of a lyrical feeling in the poems of Yunus Emre. In the following centuries, almost all folklore poets used the nightingale motif in various ways. In Divan literature, the nightingale symbolizes the lover and the rose as a beloved one, as it is in classical Eastern literature. The nightingale gave its blood to make the rose redder and more beautiful. Nightingale is a lover who cries until the morning with the longing for the rose. The nightingale sings at night, unlike other birds. Some poets accept the nightingale’s cry as a divine blessing. Poets and Prophets are also described as nightingales (a symbol of perfection). The rose is compared to the mosque, the cypress to the minaret, and the nightingale to the person who reads the Qur’an.</p>
<p>Divan literature is a literature of symbols. Each set of words used has both a symbolic and literal meaning. The tradition of expression with symbols and images, which has formed the basis of Persian and Arabic literature since the early ages, has been continued by Seljuk and Ottoman poets and writers. They have spread this legacy they took over to wide geography and enriched the content of divan literature with the new images they added to the narrative. The first Ottoman poet who contributed to this tradition and collected his writings in his divan was Aşık Pasha. In his divan, Aşık Pasha gives his readers plenty of mystical suggestions and advises them to reach God without sin. Ahmedi, who is the successor of Aşık Pasha, wrote poems and mesnevis with the understanding of mysticism. In a couplet of one of the Ahmadi ghazals, he expressed the theme of rose and nightingale in the most beautiful way by saying, “O heartsick nightingale! Do not grieve in the cage, one day that rose garden will be yours” (“Ey bülbül-ü dil hasta melul olma kafeste/Kim menzilin ol bağ ü gülistan ola birgün.”). Sheikh, one of the fifteenth century poets, says, “Let the secret of the destiny remain closed like a rosebud/ Let’s open our hearts to the joy of the rose garden” (Zamana sırrını ko, ganca gibi ser-beste/çemen sefasına dil guşa olalım). Rifai is the first Ottoman poet to use the phrase “Gül-ü Bülbül” as a name for his divan. The second mesnevi known to have been written during the Ottoman period is Fazlı’s „Gül-ü Bülbül“. Known to have been written in the 1550s this mesnevi has about twenty manuscript copies in Turkish libraries. In it, the poet wrote his Sufi understanding and attracted the attention of many European researchers with its rich content and excellent descriptions.</p>

Rose and Nightingale<br>
With emptiness in my belly<br>
wherever I look<br>
desire completely surrounds<br>
away from the country<br>
of roses and nightingales<br>
whatever I touch<br>
turns to stone.<br>
Like a balloon flies away<br>
from a child’s hand<br>
I’m looking back to the past<br>
the excitement of examination rooms<br>
the exhilaration of the last brushstroke<br>
the calligrapher in Istanbul-Çağaloğlu<br>
Frankfurt Lectures on Poetics<br>
and these days, you’re out of mind<br>
because of happiness.<br>
Away from the country<br>
of roses and nightingales<br>
I pick up lost dreams<br>
and put them in a crystal vase<br>
it’s easier<br>
to save a hundred other lives<br>
than one’s own.<br>
Someone outside there<br>
has lost love right now<br>
on the pavement it lays<br>
in front of someone’s feet<br>
a third one picks it up.<br>
Love and pain, hand in hand<br>
one finds, one loses<br>
one throws away, one burns<br>
in the daylight, in the night<br>
one screams, one falls silent.<br>
Away from the country<br>
of roses and nightingales<br>
at every street corner <br>
a gramophone wails<br>
about my misfortunate<br>
star constellation.<br>
Knights are not always triumphant<br>
dragons are not always enemies.<br>
Nobody entirely changes<br>
we should reveal to each other<br>
our inner-self<br>
which supports from within.<br>
Away from the country<br>
of roses and nightingales<br>
I pick up faded dreams<br>
and plant them in flowerpots<br>
it’s easier<br>
to save a hundred other lives<br>
than one’s own.<br>
Some nights you can’t sleep<br>
because of overtiredness<br>
a crow claws at your thoughts.<br>
Falling in love<br>
is not a question of choice<br>
an attosecond is enough<br>
to make impossible the use of mind<br>
at this time of night.<br>
Love and pain, hand in hand<br>
one finds, one loses<br>
one throws away, one burns<br>
in the daylight, in the night<br>
one is cursed, one is gifted.<br>
Some days<br>
you might lie down<br>
in your own shadow<br>
craving a strangers<br>
hand furrow.<br>
Some find it difficult<br>
to deceive themselves<br>
others to remain true.<br>
It’s neither easy to live<br>
with people<br>
nor to die<br>
lonely.<br>
In the country<br>
of roses and nightingales<br>
someone became the person<br>
I should have been.<br>
Now everything happens<br>
at places, where I am not.<br>
You can roll up in a Kilim<br>
drown in a cup of iced coffee<br>
hug a dandelion<br>
and start to weep.<br>
On my way I pick up lost dreams<br>
and knit them to a scarf of verses<br>
to warm up anyone out there<br>
warm the one who freezes.<br>
He, who never has been frozen<br>
doesn’t know about those<br>
who have experienced cold.<br>
From a distance I observe<br>
the morphology<br>
the depth psychology<br>
study what’s more clumsy<br>
the observer<br>
or everything observed.<br>
Away from the country<br>
of roses and nightingales<br>
shall what more a sculptor be<br>
if he is already a sculptor?<br>
Since he is everything when carving<br>
the arrow and the sword<br>
the visor, the magazine<br>
the surrender, the victory.<br>
In the country<br>
of roses and nightingales<br>
someone became the person<br>
I should have been.<br>
Now everything happens<br>
where I don’t find myself.<br>
Wherever I point my finger<br>
there beats my heart.<br>
You can hide behind a curtain<br>
hush reality<br>
in a glass of Bordeaux<br>
and start crying<br>
while watching a comedy.<br>
On the way I pick up discarded dreams<br>
and wrap them up cozy at home.<br>
In my pocket a watches key<br>
a rope, a rosary<br>
sometimes I pull out one<br>
sometimes the other.<br>
Away from the country<br>
of roses and nightingales<br>
I change the arrangement<br>
of the piano keys<br>
and build new sequences.<br>
On the way I pick up sodden dreams<br>
and hang them on the clothesline<br>
in my heart the heart of a nightingale<br>
I don’t know<br>
where to place the ladder of life<br>
where to put my hands and feet<br>
which mailbox to address my disappointment.<br>
Now, somewhere out there<br>
a sacred place becomes a crime scene<br>
a light bulb shatters<br>
in a Motel room far away<br>
every evening the sun burns down<br>
in a footnote the key of illumination<br>
remains lying.<br>
What else shall a poet be<br>
if she is already a poet?<br>
Since she is everything when writing<br>
the compass, the pelorus<br>
the handle, the blade<br>
the billowing, the target.<br>
On the way I pick up crumpled dreams<br>
and smooth them with an iron<br>
I long for something<br>
which never was mine.<br>
In my heart the heart of a nightingale<br>
on every street corner a saxophone<br>
sings about the tough naivety<br>
of my soul.<br>
Away from the country<br>
of roses and nightingales<br>
everything I touch<br>
turns to stone<br>
a stone is not a rose.<br>
<br>“Rose und Nachtigall” (Rose and Nightingale) by Safiye Can<br>
Translation by Hakan Ak
</i>
</p>
<p>Mehr Afshan Farooqi in her article on the subject says “The story of the rose and the bulbul is to be cherished as a metaphor for undying passion.”, “The bulbul and the rose are both important motifs in Persian literature, particularly in ghazal poetry. In mystical poetry the bulbul’s longing for the rose served as a metaphor for the soul’s yearning for union with God. The theme of the rose in Persian mystical poetry has been the subject of detailed investigation since the beginnings of Orientalist studies in Europe in the late 18th century, and poets such as Wolfgang Goethe and Rainer Maria Rilke have been inspired by their Persian counterparts. The gul-o bulbul theme fascinated Victorian society. Variations on the idea of the flower or rose as a symbol of mortality caught the imagination of poets and painters. Oscar Wilde’s poignant fairy tale The Nightingale and the Rose is the best example of reworking the gul-o bulbul theme.”</p>
<p>The nightingales are the wayfarers on the mystic path, becoming intoxicated on mystical inspiration, unable to take any interest in the affairs of the material world. The Nightingale is the Poet, the Lover, and the Rose is the Inspiration and the Beloved One. The garden of roses represents the hearts of human beings. The nightingale is the Deity and the rose is the spirituality that bedecks these “gardens of the heart”.</p>
<p>There is no greater, purer, and impossible love than the love of the Nightingale for the Rose. The nightingale dies “crucified” on the thorns of the rose, trying to reach it, and its “blood” gives redness and life to the rose. Isn’t that the perfect metaphor for the poets and their ultimate inspiration – Love?</p>
