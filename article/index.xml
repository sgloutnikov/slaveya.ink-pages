These metaphors were used by Sufi poets to describe religious mysticism, and authors outside of Sufi understanding used them to visualize the realities of social life and romance.</description></item><item><title>The Role of Bektashism in the “Awakening” and the National movement of Albania (19th and 20th century)</title><link>https://slaveya.ink/article/2021/11/29/the-role-of-bektashism-in-the-awakening-and-the-national-movement-of-albania-19th-and-20th-century/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slaveya.ink/article/2021/11/29/the-role-of-bektashism-in-the-awakening-and-the-national-movement-of-albania-19th-and-20th-century/</guid><description>The religious-philosophical ideology Bektashism originated and spread first in Asia Minor. There it was associated with the names of religious and political figures, poets, and writers such as Bektashi Veli, Balim Sultan, Gul Baba and others. Bektashi doctrines are characterized by Shiite and pantheistic character, although the influence of Shiites may be relatively late (sixteenth century). It is also believed that the Bektashi combined in their Order a significant number of doctrines and practices of diverse origins, including not only Shiism and Sufism, but also preserved pre-Islamic and non-Islamic beliefs and customs originating from Christianity and ancient religions, as well as ancient Turkic elements.</description></item><item><title>The Bulgarian “Kızılbaşı” or “the Red Heads”</title><link>https://slaveya.ink/article/2021/10/26/the-bulgarian-k%C4%B1z%C4%B1lba%C5%9F%C4%B1-or-the-red-heads/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slaveya.ink/article/2021/10/26/the-bulgarian-k%C4%B1z%C4%B1lba%C5%9F%C4%B1-or-the-red-heads/</guid><description>This interesting name “Qizilbash/Kizilbash” (“redhead” in Turkish) appeared around the 15th century when the followers of the Safavid order (Safavid dynasty of Persia) started wearing distinctive twelve-gored red hats – the so-called “Haydar’s Crown”. Soon this headwear was abandoned, but the name “Qizilbash” remained. The name was originally a pejorative label given to the Alevi believers by their Sunni Ottoman foes, but soon it was adopted as a provocative mark of pride.</description></item><item><title>„Живот в кибритена кутия” Фатос Конголи</title><link>https://slaveya.ink/article/2010/03/18/%D0%B6%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%82-%D0%B2-%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%8F-%D1%84%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%81-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Mar 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slaveya.ink/article/2010/03/18/%D0%B6%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%82-%D0%B2-%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%8F-%D1%84%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%81-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8/</guid><description>Фатос Конголи е роден в Елбасан, Албания.
