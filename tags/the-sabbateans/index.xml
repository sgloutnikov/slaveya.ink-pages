They are the crypto-Jews in the Ottoman Empire, who at the end of the 17th century abandoned Judaism and accepted Islam. The community consisted of students and followers of Shavtai Tzvi/Sabbatai Zevi, who in 1666 in Istanbul accepted Islam. Tzvi is perceived by his followers as a prophet. Wary of their Muslim neighbors, the Sabbateans kept their religious practices strictly secret, which also leads to a lesser knowledge of the community.</description></item></channel></rss>
