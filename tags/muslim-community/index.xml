The Bulgarian and Turkish names of the city Yambol and Yanbolu come from the Greek Diampolis (The City of Gods). The city is located about 100 km west of the port city of Burgas, on both banks of the Tundzha River
Yambol sits on the ruins of the Thracian settlement of Kabile, a fortress that was strengthened by Philip the Great (Alexander’s father).</description></item></channel></rss>
